• Understanding the method of channel estimation for IRS in depth by studying the problem and converting the problem
statement as denoising problem .
• Improved the existing denoising architecture by implementing U-Net architecture, which resulted in lower NMSE, MSE
and higher PSNR values in the denoised output.
